# MyReads App

This is the final project from the React course through Udacity's Front-End Developer Nanodegree.
This is an app built with React which allows you to keep a log of books that you have read, want to read and are currently reading.

## Download and set up

To get started logging your books:
* Download the app clicking here or clone this repository with: `` git clone https://github.com/LauraVillegas/MyReadsApp.git``
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## App Features
MyReads can help you:
* Keep track of what books you are reading, want to read or are currently reading by providing you with a shelves to keep them organized.
* Search page to look for more books you might want to add your collection.
* Useful information author and book cover on selected or searched titles. 
* Not interested on keeping track of an specific title? select none on it's shelf dropdown button and it will go away.
## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Code Ownership

This app's started code was taken from [Udacity's Nanodegree MyReads Project](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter) for this reason I do not own the totality of the code.
